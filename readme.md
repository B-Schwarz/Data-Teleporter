# Void Share


Void Share is a Web Application used to share files from one device to another.

### Goal

The Goal is that this Application does not save or cache any files, which are being 
transferred. Ensuring that the Files that are being shared are only accessible by Person
which have the randomly generated code. The file will not be uploaded to the host server,
instead if the data gets requested by another party, the data of the file gets send by
the sharer to the recipient. The server hosting the application is merely acting as a bridge
to connect the peers.
